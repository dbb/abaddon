##About
According to legend, Abaddon was built in the First Age by Sanclotar the Wise as a sanctuary where he could practice his arcane rituals. As his power grew, so did his citadel. Eventually it became a sprawling dungeon with labyrinths and traps on every floor. Sanclotar had a habit of throwing all those who opposed him into the very bowels of Abaddon- the Abyss of the Abject- where they would rot away in darkness for the rest of their short but miserable lives.

Over the centuries, the heirs of Sanclotar's dynasty have kept things running in much the same way. Every year, the bones of doomed prisoners begin to pile up until a great beast is unleashed in the lower levels of the prison, where he is said to feed on the dessicated remains of those unlucky enough to have been sentenced there.

However, legend also has it that one day a righteous hero will be wrongfully lock away in Abaddon, but through cunning and strength of spirit will escape and topple the ongoing reign of evil, once and for all...
